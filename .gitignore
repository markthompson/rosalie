# Notes for Team Setup
# ========================

# IMPORTANT SETUP NOTES:
# 1. Make sure to set up Git LFS for large binary files (.uasset, .umap, etc.)
# 2. Consider which plugins should be tracked vs downloaded from marketplace
# 3. Discuss with your team whether to track Starter Content
# 4. Some teams prefer to track .vscode/ settings for consistent development environment
# 5. Consider creating a .gitattributes file for proper line ending handling
